			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>Understanding our users needs - the common theme being more volunteering oppurtunities to be involved with the society as opposed to just donating. The website would have to advertise the donations, petitions and volunteering, equally. Research shows that 99% of FOUR PAWS generated income comes from donations and bequest whilst secondary research reveals participants would like to further their effort through volunteering oppurtunities. </p>

      <p>In turn three strategies were used to ideate a website that could draw in potential users so that they could help join the cause.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Brainstorming.</li>
				<li>Mood Boards.</li>
				<li>Sketches.</li>
			</ul>
      <h3 id="brainstorm">Brainstorming</h3>
      <p>The brainstorm consist of ideas that will and identify objectives which will contribute to a possible solution to help engage users with the websites content and better understand their experience.</p>
      <figure><img src = 'images/brainstorm.png' alt='brainstorm'></figure>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>For the mood board we took the idea of visuals from the brainstorm as it was a reoccuring theme that was brought up, words such as "cute animals", "videos" and "colours" became the focus. It's understood that visuals are what helps engage users with an interface and that was an experience we wanted to explore.</p>
      <figure><img src = 'images/moodboard.png' alt='moodboard'></figure>
      <p>The inspiration for the moodboard was visuals and engagement. The websites present each have a level of engagenment with the site itself apart from the buttons. This would draw the users in and become more engaged and want to understand the mission of FOUR PAWS and from their hopefully make a donation or express interest in volunteering.</p>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>Sketching the intial template will aid with the direction of the wireframes later on. The sketches will layout where different elements of the webpage will go.</p>

		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>The designs were based on the ideation phase pulling the best aspects of each idea and forming them into a user friendly website which engages the audience.</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <h3>Mobile</h3>
			<p>The mobile wireframes have a simple layout so that older users can also navigate easily.</p>
